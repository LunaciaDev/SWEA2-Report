# Some useful Macros

- `\image{imagePath}{caption}` insert an image and caption. A label is created equivalent to imagePath.
- `\eg` exempli grata, for example
- `\ie` id est, in other words
- `\ea` et alii, among others
- `\lstinputlisting[firstline,language,caption,label]{path}` input source code from path
- `\ac{acronym}` replace with the full writing + acryonum for the first appearance, the rest abbreviated.

# How to use the template

- Write your stuff inside `/chapters`
- In Thesis.tex, scroll to line 454, add your file in as `\input{chapters/file-name.tex}`
- That's it. Feel free to add citation infomation into bibliography.bib, acronym in acronyms.tex.
- I still prefer VSCode/Zettlr pair, so you will only see me copy-pasting stuff, not writing here kek.
- Will be adding a bunch more acronym allowed by APA later.
- For more instruction not covered here, see Thesis.pdf (translated by Google).
